# NBA-Player-Dashboard-
## 📚 Project Overview
This project analyzes NBA player statistics, performs data cleaning, and extracts valuable insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The objective is to compare player and team performances, integrate the cleaned dataset into an SQL database, and create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize player and team statistics effectively.

# 🎯 Objective
Analyze NBA player statistics to identify trends in performance.
Explore player statistics distribution by position and across seasons.
Evaluate team performance and compare teams using key metrics.
Compare individual players based on selected metrics.
Load cleaned data into an SQL database for querying and insights.
Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing key insights.

# 📊 Key Deliverables
